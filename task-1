 1: Install and Configure XAMPP/WAMP

    Download and install XAMPP or WAMP on your machine from their respective websites.
        XAMPP: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html (Linux)
        WAMP:  https://www.wampserver.com/ (Windows)

    Follow the installation instructions provided on the XAMPP or WAMP website to configure the software according to your requirements.

 2: Install Composer and PHP

    Install Composer on your XAMPP/WAMP environment. 
    Download Composer from the official Composer website: https://getcomposer.org/download/

    Ensure PHP is properly installed and configured within your XAMPP/WAMP environment. 
    Composer requires PHP to be in your system's PATH.

 3: Create a Laravel Project and Use XAMPP/WAMP to Run It

    Open a command prompt or terminal window.

    Create a new Laravel project using Composer:
    
    composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel my-laravel-app
    Replace "my-laravel-app" with your desired project name.

 4: Create a Hello World Controller and Use Blade Templates

    Create a "HelloController" within your Laravel project by running this command in the terminal:
	php artisan make:controller HelloController

    In the "HelloController" (located in the "app/Http/Controllers" directory), create a method to display a "Hello, World!" message.

    Create a corresponding view blade template named "hello.blade.php" in the "resources/views" directory with the appropriate HTML content.

    Modify the "helloWorld" method in your "HelloController" to return the view.

    Set up a route in the "routes/web.php" file to access your "HelloController" and view.

Now, you should be able to access your "Hello, World!" message by visiting http://localhost/my-laravel-app/public/hello in your web browser, assuming "my-laravel-app" is the name of your Laravel project folder.
